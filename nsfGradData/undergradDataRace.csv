"c Before 2008, the survey did not collect information on more than one race, and the category includes only race and ethnicity unknown. Beginning in 2008, the category includes more than one race as well as race and ethnicity unknown. From 2008 to 2010, the survey gave institutions the option to use the new racial and ethnic categories established by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) effective 1 January 2003 and to report race as more than one race. Because the use of the new categories was optional during this period of time, data on students of more than one race were not representative of all students who could be classified as being of more than one race. In 2011, the survey required institutions to begin reporting information on more than one race, along with information in the other racial and ethnic categories, but institutions were not required to update the race and ethnicity data of individuals who were already in the system. Therefore, the number reported for more than one race in 2011 is likely to be an undercount. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"NOTES: Race and ethnicity breakouts are for U.S. citizens and permanent residents only. Starting with academic year 2015–16 data, data will reflect OMB’s latest race and ethnicity categories; at that point, 4 years of data collected under these categories will become available. Temporary resident includes all racial and ethnic groups. Data are based on degree-granting institutions eligible to participate in Title IV federal financial aid programs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
